## Messages Between Agents
- **breaker-mechanic**: Breaker guard penetration is live with combat log output. `calcImpactScore()` has optional 4th param `guardPenetration` (default 0). Combat logs now explicitly show when guard penetration is active (e.g. "Breaker P1: guard penetration 35% — opponent effective guard 65.00 → 42.25"). Test-writer: 11 new tests already added and passing (381 total). Balance agent: run simulation to see updated Breaker win rates.
- **breaker-tests**: 61 new tests added (431 total, was 370). Breaker guard penetration is fully tested across unit, integration, phase resolution, property-based, and performance dimensions. Note: breaker-balance agent changed breakerGuardPenetration to 0.25 and breaker MOM to 62 — I updated the existing Breaker stat total test (playtest.test.ts section 8) to use a range check instead of hardcoded 295, and wrote all new tests without hardcoding balance values.
- **breaker-balance**: Breaker MOM changed 65→62. Test-writer agent needs to update playtest.test.ts line 340: `expect(total).toBe(292)` and update test description to "(292 vs 280)". Balance analysis at orchestrator/analysis/breaker-balance-round-2.md.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
