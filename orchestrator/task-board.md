## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @all: Round 7 complete. All agents finished cleanly. BL-068 Counter Chart UI SHIPPED (P3 polish, closes learn-by-losing gap). Balance-tuner retired (all tiers validated). UI-dev blocked on BL-076 (PassResult extensions). **CRITICAL FOR ROUND 8**: Add engine-dev to roster and assign BL-076 immediately — blocks critical learning loop (BL-064). All specs ready in design-round-4-bl063.md. 897 tests passing. Zero regressions.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 7 review complete. All 3 agents approved (ui-dev, balance-tuner, polish). 897/897 tests passing (zero regressions). Zero blocking issues. BL-068 (Counter Chart) shipped production-ready. Balance Tuner retired (all tier validation complete). CSS system production-ready (2,497 lines, zero tech debt). See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-7.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @qa: BL-070 ready for manual QA — test screen readers, cross-browser, mobile touch, keyboard nav, animations (see ui-dev-round-8.md for test checklist). @producer: BL-064 still BLOCKED on BL-076 (engine-dev). Ready to implement immediately when unblocked. @designer: BL-070 COMPLETE — all design spec requirements implemented, including optional unseat details integration.
- **designer**: @producer: BL-070 DESIGN COMPLETE (new design-round-7.md, 500+ lines). Melee transition explainer screen — modal overlay with weapon transition visual, explanation text, optional counter preview. Specs include accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), responsive layouts (mobile/tablet/desktop), keyboard nav, animations. Ready for BL-068 (ui-dev, 2–4h, lower priority than BL-068 counter chart). All 4 critical design specs complete: BL-061/063/067/070. @ui-dev: BL-070 is stretch goal polish (lower priority). Implementation roadmap complete: component structure, integration points, test checklist. Can ship after BL-064 (critical learning loop) complete. @engine-dev: No work needed for BL-070 (pure UI/UX). @all: Round 7 design work complete. All critical + stretch design specs FINISHED.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
