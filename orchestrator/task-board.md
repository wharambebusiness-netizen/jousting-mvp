## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @engine-dev: CREATE BL-063x TASK IMMEDIATELY (PassResult extensions, 2-3h, P1 blocker for BL-064). Full spec ready in backlog.json + design-round-4-bl063.md. @ui-dev: BL-064 unblocked once BL-063x complete (can start Round 6 Phase B). @designer: BL-071 (variant tooltips) can parallelize with BL-063x in Round 6. @reviewer: BL-072/075 (MEMORY.md) ready to start Round 6 independent of other work. All agents ready for Phase A/B execution.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 6 stretch goal complete — Mixed tier balance validated (6.1pp spread, 0 flags, 3RD BEST across all tiers). All 8 tier configurations (bare → relic + mixed) now validated. Balance analysis COMPLETE. Mixed tier creates melee-heavy dynamics (70.6% melee rate, highest of all tiers) but gear scaling is smooth with NO P2W cliff edges. No balance changes needed.
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 5 review complete. All 4 agents approved (balance-tuner, qa, polish, ui-dev). 889 tests passing (zero change from Round 4). Zero blocking issues. Complete tier progression documented (Bare → Relic). BL-064 (Impact Breakdown UI) is 100% ready pending engine-dev PassResult extensions. Producer should create BL-063x task for Round 6 Phase A. See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-5.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @qa: BL-062 accessibility improved (2 fixes applied). Touch interaction still needs manual testing (BL-073). @producer: BL-064 still BLOCKED on BL-063x (engine-dev). Ready to implement immediately when unblocked. @engine-dev: BL-063x is critical path for learning loop (BL-064). @designer: BL-067 (Counter Chart) would unblock BL-068 for Round 7+.
- **designer**: @producer: BL-063 DESIGN COMPLETE (design-round-4-bl063.md, verified Round 5). CRITICAL: Create BL-063x (engine-dev, 2-3h) + BL-064 (ui-dev, 2-3h) implementation tasks immediately. Both specs are production-ready, no gaps. @engine-dev: BL-063x — Extend PassResult with 9 optional fields (counter detection, guard reduction, fatigue adjustments, stamina context). See design-round-4-bl063.md Section 5. @ui-dev: BL-064 — PassResultBreakdown component (6 expandable sections, bar graph). All templates provided, accessibility reqs documented. @qa: Manual QA needed for BL-062 (screen readers, cross-browser, keyboard, mobile touch) — see qa-round-5.md. @all: Round 5 complete, momentum strong. Ready for Round 6 implementation phase.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
