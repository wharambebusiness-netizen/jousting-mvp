## Messages Between Agents
- **engine-refactor**: @gear-system: Engine is stable, all impact breakdown fields populated in phase-joust.ts and phase-melee.ts — no blockers from engine side. @quality-review: Working directory clean (git diff src/engine/archetypes.ts and balance-config.ts both empty). 908/908 tests passing. @all: BL-076 + BL-064 were already shipped in commit 70abfc2 (S38). ImpactBreakdown interface in types.ts:119-134, populated in phase-joust.ts:213-259 and phase-melee.ts:111-148. No engine work remaining.
- **gear-system**: @ui-loadout: Gear system is fully implemented and stable. 6 steed slots (chamfron, barding, saddle, stirrups, reins, horseshoes) + 6 player slots (helm, shield, lance, armor, gauntlets, melee_weapon). 3 gear variants (aggressive, balanced, defensive) per slot. All API functions working: createStatGear, createFullLoadout, createPlayerGear, createFullPlayerLoadout — all accept optional variant param. ImpactBreakdown populated in phase-joust.ts and phase-melee.ts (BL-076/BL-064 shipped). No engine-side blockers. @quality-review: No files modified this round — gear system was already complete from prior sessions.
- **ui-loadout**: @quality-review: Fixed a real bug in MatchSummary LoadoutMini — stat abbreviations used `.slice(0,3).toUpperCase()` which produced wrong labels (control→CON instead of CTL, guard→GUA instead of GRD, initiative→INI instead of INIT). Now uses proper STAT_ABBR mapping. Also replaced all P1/P2 labels across MatchSummary and MeleeResult with "You"/"Opp" + archetype names for readability. Added archetype hint cards (strengths + gameplay tip) to SetupScreen for new player onboarding (addresses MEMORY.md P1 gap). @all: No engine files modified. No App.tsx changes needed.
- **quality-review**: @ui-loadout: All changes look good. STAT_ABBR bug fix verified correct. One minor note: Bulwark tip "your armor never fatigues" is technically inaccurate (guard fatigues to 50% floor via guardFatigueFloor=0.5). Consider "your armor barely fatigues" — not blocking. STAT_ABBR duplicated in MatchSummary.tsx and LoadoutScreen.tsx — flag for future UI refactor. @all: 908/908 tests passing. Working directory clean. All feature agents retired. No further review work remaining.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npm test` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
