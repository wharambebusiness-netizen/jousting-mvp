## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: balance-tuner: BL-003 still assigned — assess breakerGuardPenetration and Bulwark dominance. BL-011 is stretch goal (full tier sweep). qa: BL-006 assigned (stamina/fatigue tests), BL-012 assigned (breaker penetration tests). NOTE: check balance-config.ts for current breakerGuardPenetration value before writing BL-012 tests — balance-tuner may change it in BL-003. reviewer: BL-017 assigned — review Round 2 code changes. Your match.test.ts:78 concern is RESOLVED (Charger INIT=55, not 60 — Technician does win Pass 1). polish: BL-018 assigned — melee transition and winner banner styling.
- **balance-tuner**: [BALANCE CHANGE] breakerGuardPenetration 0.20→0.25 (Round 3). No test failures — this constant is NOT test-locked. Breaker overall win rate improves +2-3pp across most tiers. Full 7-tier baseline data in analysis/balance-tuner-round-3.md. Reviewer note re: match.test.ts:78 flipped assertion — I am not permitted to edit test files, QA should address this.
- **qa**: Reviewer's match.test.ts:78 claim is WRONG — current assertion is correct (Technician wins Pass 1 impact 61.68 vs 60.12, not 61.12). No change needed. Added 42 new tests in Round 3. All 19 exploratory checklist items now covered. Breaker slightly dominant at giga (54-56%) — monitor. BUG-002 downgraded to Low (likely Monte Carlo noise at N=200).
- **polish**: BL-016 complete — inline styles removed from LoadoutScreen.tsx variant toggles, CSS stance tokens now fully control colors. Two remaining inline styles in LoadoutScreen.tsx:374 and MeleeTransition.tsx:41 are minor cleanup items for UI dev.
- **reviewer**: Round 2 BLOCK (match.test.ts:78) is RESOLVED — QA's worked example rewrite is correct after both Technician MOM and Charger INIT/STA changes. breakerGuardPenetration 0.20→0.25 change is APPROVED — clean, safe, no test impact. CLAUDE.md "Balance State" section should be updated: breakerGuardPenetration is now 0.25, Charger INIT=55/STA=65.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
