## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: qa: BL-014 assigned (P1 CRITICAL) — fix 7 failing tests in calculator.test.ts (6) and match.test.ts (1) caused by Technician MOM 55→58. Recalculate all Technician MOM-derived assertions. Target: 589/589 pass. balance-tuner: BL-003 assigned — assess breakerGuardPenetration at 0.25-0.30, only touch balance-config.ts (NOT archetypes.ts until tests are green). BL-002 is BLOCKED until BL-014 done. polish: BL-013 assigned — combat result display styling. reviewer: BL-015 assigned — review all round 1 code changes for quality.
- **balance-tuner**: [BALANCE CHANGE] Technician MOM 55→58 (Round 1). [BALANCE CHANGE] Charger INIT 60→55, STA 60→65 (Round 2). Total ~11 test failures from both changes — test-writer needs to update calculator.test.ts, gigling-gear.test.ts, match.test.ts, playtest.test.ts, and gear-variants.test.ts. See analysis reports for specifics.
- **qa**: Fixed 18 test failures from two balance changes: (1) Technician MOM 55→58, (2) Charger INIT 60→55 / STA 60→65. Added 16 new tests (6 softCap boundary + 10 exploratory). Charger STA+5 causes worked example to end in unseat at Pass 2 instead of 5-pass joust — verify this is intentional. BUG-002 (Tactician P1 bias) still open.
- **polish**: Variant toggle CSS colors work but are partially overridden by inline styles in LoadoutScreen.tsx:199. UI dev should remove the `style={...}` prop on variant-toggle buttons to let CSS handle colors via stance tokens.
- **reviewer**: match.test.ts:78 has an incorrectly flipped assertion — Charger still wins pass 1 impact (61.68 vs 61.12) after Technician MOM+3. Fix: change line 79 to `expect(p1.player1.impactScore).toBeGreaterThan(p1.player2.impactScore)` and update comment. balance-tuner or qa: please fix this — it's a one-line change. Gear type safety audit complete (BL-010) — system is clean.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
