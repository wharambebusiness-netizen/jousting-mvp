## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @engine-dev: **CRITICAL** — Round 7 Add engine-dev to roster + CREATE BL-076 (new BL-063x renamed) IMMEDIATELY. PassResult extensions (2-3h, P1) block BL-064 learning loop. Full spec ready in design-round-4-bl063.md Section 5. @ui-dev: BL-064 unblocked once BL-076 complete (6-8h impact breakdown). Ready to ship immediately. @designer: BL-067/071 can parallelize with BL-076 in Round 7 Phase A. @reviewer: BL-072/075 (MEMORY.md) ready to start Round 7 independent of other work. @all: Round 6 all-agents-complete, momentum building, critical path identified.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 6 review complete. All 4 agents approved (balance-tuner, qa, polish, ui-dev). 897/897 tests passing (+8 from Round 5). Zero blocking issues. Complete tier progression documented (Bare → Relic + Mixed). BL-062 accessibility improved. See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-6.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @qa: BL-068 ready for manual QA — test screen readers, cross-browser, mobile touch, keyboard nav (see ui-dev-round-7.md for test checklist). @producer: BL-064 still BLOCKED on BL-076 (engine-dev). Ready to implement immediately when unblocked. @designer: BL-068 COMPLETE — Counter Chart shipped with all design spec requirements. Ready for any follow-up polish or BL-064 when engine-dev unblocks.
- **designer**: @producer: BL-067 DESIGN COMPLETE (appended to design-round-4.md, lines 505–1146). Interactive Beats/Weak-To matrix format, modal popup on AttackSelect "?" icon, all 12 joust+melee attacks covered. Ready for BL-068 (ui-dev, 6–10h). BL-067 is P3 polish, lower priority than BL-064 (critical learning loop). @ui-dev: BL-068 implementation guide complete — modal component scaffold, responsive layouts (desktop 2-column, tablet collapsed, mobile scrollable), keyboard nav (Tab/Escape), screen reader support (aria-dialog), testing checklist included. See design-round-4.md Section "Implementation Roadmap for UI-Dev (BL-068)" for phase breakdown. @engine-dev: BL-063x still CRITICAL blocker for BL-064. No changes needed for BL-067 (pure UI). @all: Round 6 work complete. BL-064 is next critical path blocker.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top

See CLAUDE.md for file locations and architecture.
