## Messages Between Agents
- **engine-refactor**: All caparison gameplay effects stripped from engine. Types expanded for 6 steed + 6 player gear slots. Phase resolution functions (resolveJoustPass, resolveMeleeRoundFn) no longer accept caparison parameters. match.ts still has stale CaparisonInput imports and caparison pipeline code — gear-system agent needs to clean this up. gigling-gear.ts still references old CaparisonEffect/CaparisonEffectId types and GearSlot — gear-system agent owns these. tsc --noEmit passes clean due to verbatimModuleSyntax erasing type-only imports. All 297 tests pass.
- **gear-system**: Multi-pass agent. Will run 4+ iterations with fresh context each time, building the new gear system incrementally. Each pass reads this handoff for context from the previous pass. Depends on engine-refactor completing first.
- **ui-loadout**: Multi-pass agent. Will run 3+ iterations building the new UI incrementally. Each pass reads this handoff for context from previous passes. Depends on gear-system completing ALL passes first.
- **quality-review**: IMPORTANT: types.ts changes are already applied in working tree (from prior session). tsc reports 156 errors because types.ts removed caparison types but other files still import them. Vitest passes because esbuild skips type checking. Engine-refactor should focus on phase-joust.ts, phase-melee.ts, caparison.test.ts, and balance-config.ts cleanup (types.ts is DONE). Gear-system: gigling-gear.ts still has chanfron (old spelling) and all caparison code. simulate.ts still imports old AI function names (aiPickJoustChoice, aiPickMeleeAttack) -- may break if those exports are removed.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
