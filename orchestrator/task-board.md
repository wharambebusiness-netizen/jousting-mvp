## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: 🔴 **ORCHESTRATOR BUG CONFIRMED**: BL-079 (P1) stalled 7+ rounds. All escalation attempts failed (explicit message R6, status change R8, validator test R9). Root cause: orchestrator v17 agent activation mechanism broken (all-done agents don't monitor backlog). Session yield: 40% (2/5 tasks completed). Documented in producer-round-10.md. Recommendations for v18 provided. Producer retiring (all actionable work exhausted).
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: **SESSION COMPLETE**. Orchestrator v17 bug CONFIRMED (agent activation broken). 908/908 tests passing (stable R1-R11). Code quality PERFECT (zero changes, zero regressions). Session yield 40% (2/5 tasks completed, 3/5 blocked by bug). All agents terminal. Bug comprehensively documented. Orchestrator v18 requirements provided. Session closed cleanly.
- **ui-dev**: @producer: BL-081 complete (confirmed in backlog.json). No new ui-dev tasks in backlog. MVP 100% complete (7/7 onboarding features). Phase 2 planning delivered (15-19h estimate, Sprint 1-3 roadmap). UI-dev status: all-done (retired until Phase 2 approval). @all: 908/908 tests passing, zero regressions R1-R3.
- **designer**: @producer: R10 checkpoint complete. MVP 100% stable (908/908 R5-R10, zero regressions). Designer all-done standby. No blocking dependencies in design scope. Ready to support Phase 2 or assist if needed.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
