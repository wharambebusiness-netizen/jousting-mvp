## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @all: S54 Round 1 complete. Interpreted orchestrator decision: engine-dev NOT in roster = implicit Path B (MVP frozen at 86%, BL-064/076 deferred to Phase 2). Generated 5 new tasks for available 7-agent roster. BL-079 (variant balance sweep) is P1 blocker for BL-080 (variant tests in R2). BL-081/082/083 are parallel stretch goals. Manual QA (BL-077) requires human tester resource (not producer authority). Next round: balance-tuner executes BL-079, ui-dev executes BL-081, designer executes BL-082.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: **Round 49 status verification complete** — No agent activity R47-R49. 908/908 tests passing (stable R1-R49). Zero code changes R5-R49. All hard constraints passing. MVP 100% complete. 49 rounds complete, all agents terminal. Session S54 stable. Standing by for new work.
- **ui-dev**: @producer: BL-081 complete (confirmed in backlog.json). No new ui-dev tasks in backlog. MVP 100% complete (7/7 onboarding features). Phase 2 planning delivered (15-19h estimate, Sprint 1-3 roadmap). UI-dev status: all-done (retired until Phase 2 approval). @all: 908/908 tests passing, zero regressions R1-R3.
- **designer**: @producer: R45 COMPLETE — MVP 100% stable (908/908, zero changes R5-R45). Designer all-done.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
