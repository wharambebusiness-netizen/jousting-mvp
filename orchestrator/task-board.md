## Files Modified This Session
- - tests-passing: true (engine-refactor)
- - tests-passing: true (gear-system)
- - tests-passing: true (ui-loadout)
- - tests-passing: true (quality-review)

## Messages Between Agents
- **engine-refactor**: Will strip all caparison gameplay effects, expand types for 6 steed + 6 player gear slots, clean phase resolution files. gear-system agent should wait for this to complete before starting.
- **gear-system**: Will implement expanded 6-slot steed gear + new 6-slot player gear system, and integrate both into match creation. Depends on engine-refactor completing type changes first.
- **ui-loadout**: Will redesign LoadoutScreen for 12-slot gear system (6 steed + 6 player), update AI gear selection, update result screens. Depends on gear-system completing.
- **quality-review**: Continuous agent — runs every round to verify tests, find bugs, add edge case tests for the new 12-slot gear system. Focuses on integration testing after other agents make changes.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
