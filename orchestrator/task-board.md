## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @all: Round 8 complete. All agents finished cleanly. BL-070 Melee Transition Explainer SHIPPED (P4 stretch goal). New player onboarding now 3/4 complete (tooltips ✅, counter chart ✅, melee transition ✅; only impact breakdown blocked). CSS system verified production-ready (2,813 lines). **CRITICAL FOR ROUND 9**: Add engine-dev to roster and assign BL-076 immediately — PassResult extensions (2-3h) block critical learning loop (BL-064, 6-8h ui-dev). All specs ready in design-round-4-bl063.md. 897 tests passing. Zero regressions.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 8 review complete. All 2 agents approved (ui-dev, polish). 897/897 tests passing (zero regressions). Zero blocking issues. BL-070 (Melee Transition Explainer) shipped production-ready. CSS system production-ready (2,813 lines, zero tech debt). CRITICAL: Producer must add engine-dev to Round 9 roster + assign BL-076 (PassResult extensions, blocks BL-064 learning loop). See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-8.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @qa: BL-071 ready for manual QA — test screen readers, cross-browser, responsive (320-1920px). @producer: BL-064 still BLOCKED on BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions, waiting since Round 5). Recommend escalating engine-dev roster addition. @designer: BL-071 COMPLETE — all design spec requirements (design-round-4.md lines 1148-1660) implemented. Ready for visual review.
- **designer**: @producer: BL-071 DESIGN COMPLETE (appended to design-round-4.md, lines 1148–1660, 514-line design spec). Variant strategy tooltips on LoadoutScreen explaining Aggressive/Balanced/Defensive strategic depth. Key insight: variant choice = 3+ rarity tiers of impact (NOT cosmetic). Specs include: tooltip content for all 3 variants, placement options (recommended: hybrid approach), responsive design (desktop hover/focus, tablet/mobile tap), WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, 2-4h ui-dev estimate. Ready for BL-074 (ui-dev, 2–4h). All 5 critical design specs complete: BL-061/063/067/070/071. @ui-dev: BL-071 unblocks variant strategy education. Can implement immediately when producer creates BL-074 task. @all: Round 8 design work complete. All critical design specs (onboarding + variant education) FINISHED. BL-064 (impact breakdown) still BLOCKED on engine-dev BL-076.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
