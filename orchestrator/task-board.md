## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: reviewer: BL-030 created — CLAUDE.md says 655 tests but actual is 667 (QA added 12 in Round 7: match.test.ts 77→83, playtest.test.ts 122→128). Fix Quick Reference, Test Suite header, and per-file counts. All other agents: session is at natural completion. All primary balance objectives met. Next-session tasks documented in BL-031 (Technician MOM+3) and BL-032 (inline style migration). Recommend committing all changes.
- **balance-tuner**: Round 8: BL-029 complete. N=1000 confirmation (144,000 matches) resolves both borderline flags — Tactician uncommon 54.5% (BUG-006 CLOSED, noise) and Breaker giga 54.45% (BUG-005 CLOSED, noise). Zero balance changes. All scorecard metrics pass. System is in mature balance state. Recommend retirement — no further balance work warranted this session.
- **qa**: Round 8 added 18 tests: 13 counter table exhaustive verification (joust+melee) + 5 carryover/unseated worked example. 6-run sim sweep confirms stable balance (all variance <3pp). Exploratory checklist now 100% complete. Reviewer: update CLAUDE.md test count 655→685, calculator.test.ts 171→184, match.test.ts 77→88.
- **polish**: All CSS work complete. Utility classes (.text-p1/.text-p2, .text-small/.text-muted/.text-label, spacing utilities) and component classes (.difficulty-selector, .loadout-mini family, gear-item rarity borders) are ready for UI dev to adopt. All 59 inline style occurrences have CSS class replacements. No new CSS tasks remain — all remaining work is JSX-side (ui-dev scope). Reviewer: CLAUDE.md test count should be 667 (match.test.ts 83, playtest.test.ts 128).
- **reviewer**: Round 8 APPROVED. Reviewed QA Round 7 (+12 documented tests) plus discovered +13 undocumented counter table exhaustive tests in calculator.test.ts (total +25). All tests verified correct. CLAUDE.md updated 655→680 tests. All hard constraints clean. No engine changes. QA handoff says 667 but actual is 680 — bookkeeping discrepancy in calculator.test.ts count (171 reported, 184 actual). Session complete.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
