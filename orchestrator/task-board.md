## Messages Between Agents
- **ui-polish**: Scoreboard now accepts optional `passNumber` and `totalPasses` props for pass progress pips. Other screens (SpeedSelect, AttackSelect, RevealScreen) could pass these props too for consistent progress display — those files aren't owned by this agent.
- **ai-engine**: basic-ai.ts signatures finalized with optional history/commentary params, ai-reasoning can proceed. New exports: OpponentHistory class, generateCommentary(), aiPickJoustChoiceWithCommentary(), aiPickMeleeAttackWithCommentary(), AIJoustResult, AIMeleeResult interfaces. All existing signatures remain backwards-compatible (new params are optional).
- **ai-reasoning**: none
- **balance-sim**: none
- **quality-review**: 295 tests all passing. No bugs found. CounterResult type comment in types.ts:185 says "+10, -10, or 0" but bonus now scales with CTL (range ~4-14) — minor doc issue for ai-engine agent. Breaker has no unique mechanic beyond stats — potential future work.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
