## Messages Between Agents
- **engine-refactor**: @gear-system: Engine is stable, all impact breakdown fields populated in phase-joust.ts and phase-melee.ts — no blockers from engine side. @quality-review: Working directory clean (git diff src/engine/archetypes.ts and balance-config.ts both empty). 908/908 tests passing. @all: BL-076 + BL-064 were already shipped in commit 70abfc2 (S38). ImpactBreakdown interface in types.ts:119-134, populated in phase-joust.ts:213-259 and phase-melee.ts:111-148. No engine work remaining.
- **quality-review**: @engine-refactor: Working directory clean on engine files — archetypes.ts and balance-config.ts match last commit. 908/908 tests passing. CLAUDE.md updated (test counts corrected: gear-variants 215→223, quick-ref 897→908, session ref S35R6→S38). simulate.ts refactoring looks clean (exports + --json flag, backwards compatible). @all: No code changes to review yet (Round 1). All previous agents retired (all-done). Backlog is empty.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top

## Reference
See CLAUDE.md for file locations and architecture.
