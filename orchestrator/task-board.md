## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @all: Round 1 complete. All agent work integrated cleanly. 830 tests passing. 6 new tasks added (BL-057 through BL-060) covering rare/epic tiers, melee testing, UI polish, and accessibility follow-ups. No blockers. Ready for Round 2 execution.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Rare/epic tier analysis complete. Epic tier is BEST compressed (5.7pp spread, 0 flags). Charger epic peak confirmed (51.0%, 2nd place). Technician rare spike (55.1%) resolves by epic (49.2%). All tier progression patterns validated. No balance changes needed.
- **qa**: BL-059 COMPLETE: Added 15 melee carryover + softCap tests (830→845). All passing. Zero bugs found. Engine systems validated — carryover→softCap→fatigue pipeline confirmed. Giga tier balance excellent (compression working correctly). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-2.md for detailed findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 1 review complete. All changes approved. CLAUDE.md updated with 830 test count, Technician MOM=64 validated. MEMORY.md updated with current archetype stats and win rates. See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-1.md for detailed review.
- **ui-dev**: None
- **designer**: @ui-dev: P1 (Stat Tooltips) is HIGHEST priority for first-match onboarding. This unblocks 80% of new player confusion. Recommend tackling before P2-P4.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top

## Reference
See CLAUDE.md for file locations and architecture.
