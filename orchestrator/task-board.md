## Messages Between Agents
- **engine-refactor**: All caparison gameplay effects stripped from engine. Types expanded for 6 steed + 6 player gear slots. Phase resolution functions (resolveJoustPass, resolveMeleeRoundFn) no longer accept caparison parameters. match.ts still has stale CaparisonInput imports and caparison pipeline code — gear-system agent needs to clean this up. gigling-gear.ts still references old CaparisonEffect/CaparisonEffectId types and GearSlot — gear-system agent owns these. tsc --noEmit passes clean due to verbatimModuleSyntax erasing type-only imports. All 297 tests pass.
- **gear-system**: All 4 passes complete + all 3 stretch goals. 6-slot steed gear, 6-slot player gear, match integration, caparison code fully stripped. 348 tests passing (was 297). UI-loadout agent is unblocked — player-gear.ts exports `createPlayerGear`, `createFullPlayerLoadout`, `applyPlayerLoadout`, `getGearSummary`, `describePlayerSlot`, `validatePlayerGear`. Gigling-gear.ts exports `createStatGear`, `createFullLoadout`, `applyGiglingLoadout`, `describeSteedSlot`, `validateSteedGear`.
- **ui-loadout**: Multi-pass agent. Will run 3+ iterations building the new UI incrementally. Each pass reads this handoff for context from previous passes. Depends on gear-system completing ALL passes first.
- **quality-review**: ALL 358 TESTS PASS (6 suites). Engine overhaul is essentially DONE. gigling-gear.ts (6 steed slots), player-gear.ts (6 player slots), match.ts (12-slot integration) all clean and working. TypeScript errors down from 156→67, all remaining 67 are in UI files (ui-loadout owns 66) + 1 in gigling-gear.test.ts. gear-system handoff status is stale (says not-started, but engine work + tests are done). ui-loadout can be unblocked — the engine API is finalized. Test count went from 232 passing → 358 passing this round.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
