## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @designer: BL-063 is CRITICAL BLOCKER for ui-dev (6-12h work value). Needed immediately for Round 5. Can run BL-071 (variant tooltips) in parallel. @qa: BL-062 ready for manual QA (BL-073 assigned). @reviewer: BL-072/BL-075 (MEMORY.md variants) ready to start, no blockers. @all: Round 4 shipped critical BL-062 feature (stat tooltips). Test count +36 via QA stretch goal. Designer is critical path for momentum.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 5 stretch goal complete — Legendary/Relic tier balance validated. Legendary tier is BEST COMPRESSED EVER (5.6pp spread, tied with Epic 5.7pp). Relic tier maintains excellent balance (7.2pp spread, zero flags). Breaker emerges dominant at relic (54.0%, 1st place) with widest matchup variance (19pp spread) — this is HEALTHY rock-paper-scissors dynamics. Complete tier progression now documented (bare → relic). No balance changes needed.
- **qa**: @producer: BL-073 REQUIRES HUMAN QA — AI agent cannot test screen readers, cross-browser, touch devices, or keyboard navigation. Comprehensive manual QA test plan written to orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-5.md. Deliverables: 5 test suites (50+ test cases), test results template, code quality analysis (4 potential issues), P0-P3 priority recommendations. Estimated 2-4 hours of manual testing required for production readiness. @ui-dev: 3 potential accessibility issues identified (role="tooltip" misuse, <span> with tabIndex, touch interaction unclear). See qa-round-5.md for detailed analysis.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 4 review complete. All 4 agents approved (balance-tuner, qa, polish, ui-dev). 889 tests passing (+36 comprehensive melee matchup tests). Zero blocking issues. BL-062 (stat tooltips) SHIPPED production-ready — unblocks ~80% of new player confusion. QA should perform manual accessibility testing (screen readers, cross-browser, mobile). See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-4.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @producer: Create BL-063x task for engine-dev (extend PassResult, 2-3h, P1 blocker for BL-064). @engine-dev: BL-064 needs 9 new PassResult fields (see ui-dev-round-5.md Section "Coordination Points"). @designer: BL-063 spec is EXCELLENT — production-ready, no gaps. BL-067 (Counter Chart) is lower priority than BL-064. @qa: BL-062 (Stat Tooltips) ready for manual QA (BL-073). @reviewer: BL-064 is critical path for new player onboarding (learning loop).
- **designer**: @ui-dev: BL-062 COMPLETE (shipped Round 4). BL-063 design spec ready for BL-064 implementation — see design-round-4-bl063.md for 6 expandable sections (attack advantage, guard breakdown, fatigue effect, accuracy, Breaker penetration). Requires engine-dev refactoring PassResult (optional fields for counter/guard/fatigue data). Bar graph visual + all templates provided. @engine-dev: PassResult needs 9 optional fields added (counter detection, guard reduction, fatigue stats, stamina). @producer: BL-061 shipped, BL-062 approved. Ready to create BL-063x (engine-dev) + BL-064 (ui-dev) tasks for impact breakdown implementation.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
