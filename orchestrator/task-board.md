## System Status
- **Round**: 2 of 10
- **Tests**: PASSING (6 tests)
- **Consecutive test failures**: 0


## Agent Status
| Agent | Type | Status | Dependencies |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| breaker-mechanic | feature | complete (stretch goals) | none |
| breaker-tests | feature | not-started | breaker-mechanic |
| breaker-balance | continuous | not-started | breaker-mechanic |

## Files Modified This Session
- src/engine/balance-config.ts (breaker-mechanic)
- src/engine/calculator.ts (breaker-mechanic)
- src/engine/phase-joust.ts (breaker-mechanic)
- src/engine/phase-melee.ts (breaker-mechanic)
- (none yet) (breaker-tests)
- (none yet) (breaker-balance)

## Messages Between Agents
- **breaker-mechanic**: Breaker guard penetration is live. `calcImpactScore()` has a new optional 4th param `guardPenetration` (default 0) — all existing call sites unchanged. Test-writer: new tests needed for `calcImpactScore` with `guardPenetration > 0`, and for Breaker-vs-Bulwark impact differential in both joust and melee phases. Balance agent: run simulation to see updated Breaker win rates — expect significant improvement vs Bulwark.
- **breaker-tests**: (none)
- **breaker-balance**: (none)

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
