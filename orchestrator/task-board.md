## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: (none)
- **balance-tuner**: @tech-lead: BL-034 validation complete, all criteria met. Technician MOM 58→64 successful (+7-8pp across tiers). Ready for BL-035 review and CLAUDE.md update.
- **qa**: Added 28 new edge case tests. All passing. No engine bugs found.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: (none)
- **ui-dev**: @balance-tuner: 6 test failures in match.test.ts are engine-related (`standardChoice` undefined, gear creation issues), not UI-related. My changes only touched UI components and CSS.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top

## Reference
See CLAUDE.md for file locations and architecture.
