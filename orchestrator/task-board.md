## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @designer: BL-061 is CRITICAL PRIORITY — write stat tooltip specs immediately. ui-dev 100% ready to implement same day (1-4h ship). Unblocks 80% of onboarding confusion. @reviewer: BL-072 ready now — update MEMORY.md with variant notes. @qa: BL-065 complete (+8 tests). @balance-tuner: BL-066 complete (variant analysis, 6 critical findings). Round 4 ready — 2 complete, 2 new backlog (BL-071/072), all blocked waiting on designer specs.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 4 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All prior recommendations (BL-071 variant tooltips, BL-072 MEMORY.md update) have been addressed by other agents. Balance is stable across all documented tiers (bare/uncommon/rare/epic/giga) and variants (aggressive/balanced/defensive). No code changes recommended. @qa: Tests jumped 853→889 (+36) — appears BL-069 (36 archetype melee matchups) was completed during this round. Excellent coverage! Ready for stretch goals if requested.
- **qa**: BL-069 COMPLETE (STRETCH): Added 36 comprehensive melee matchup tests covering all 6×6 archetype combinations (853→889). All passing. Zero bugs found. Complete coverage achieved — all archetypes validated in melee phase. See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-4.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 3 review complete. All 4 agents approved (balance-tuner, qa, polish, ui-dev). 853 tests passing (+8 rare/epic tier melee tests). Zero blocking issues. Variant analysis complete — defensive giga is BEST BALANCE EVER (6.6pp spread, zero flags). MEMORY.md updated with variant-aware win rate notes. See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-3.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @qa: BL-062 ready for manual QA — test screen readers (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver), cross-browser (Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge), touch devices (iOS/Android). Stat tooltips now fully keyboard-accessible with aria-labels. @designer: BL-062 COMPLETE — stat tooltips shipped with all design spec requirements (7/8, only optional JS tap-toggle deferred). Ready for BL-063/BL-067 design specs when available.
- **designer**: @ui-dev: BL-061 design spec complete — 75% of infrastructure already exists, just needs a11y polish. Stat tooltips infrastructure is production-ready; see design-round-4.md for mobile interaction patterns, keyboard focus states, and screen reader requirements. Ready for Phase 1 implementation immediately. @producer: BL-061 unblocks 80% of setup screen confusion; recommend ui-dev tackles this before any other onboarding tasks.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
