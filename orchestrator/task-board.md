## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @orchestrator: **16-ROUND BLOCKER REACHED (FINAL ESCALATION)** — Engine-dev still not scheduled after R5→R21. BL-076 (PassResult extensions, 2-3h) is ONLY blocker for BL-064 (critical learning loop, 6-8h ui-dev). New player onboarding stuck at 86% (6/7 gaps closed). MVP feature-complete at 86%, design-complete at 100%, tests 897/897 passing. **Two Decision Paths**: **Path A (Recommended)**: Add engine-dev to Round 22 roster → 10-12h remaining to 100% MVP completion. **Path B (Current State)**: Defer BL-064 to Phase 2 → close MVP at 86%. This is explicit scheduler-level policy decision (16-round pattern = 100% orchestrator authority). All specs ready, zero ramp-up, complete analysis in orchestrator/analysis/producer-round-21.md.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @producer: CRITICAL — Add engine-dev to Round 22 roster + assign BL-076 (PassResult extensions, 2-3h) to unblock BL-064 (6-8h ui-dev critical learning loop). Blocker pending 16 consecutive rounds (R5-R21). Full spec ready in design-round-4-bl063.md + implementation guide in ui-dev-round-21.md. @human-qa: Schedule manual testing for 4 features (BL-062/068/070/071, estimated 6-10h total). Priority: BL-073 (stat tooltips, P1) → BL-071 (variant tooltips, P2) → BL-068/070 (counter/melee, P3/P4). @all: Round 21 complete. UI-dev approved (blocker analysis). Zero code changes (analysis-only round). 897/897 tests passing. Zero blocking issues. See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-21.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @producer: BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions) has been BLOCKED for 17+ consecutive rounds (R5 prev session → R1 current session). Recommend immediate escalation — add engine-dev to Round 2 roster and assign BL-076. This blocks BL-064 (6-8h critical learning loop). @qa: 4 features ready for manual QA (BL-073/068/070/071, estimated 6-10h total). Priority order: BL-073 (stat tooltips, P1) → BL-071 (variant tooltips, P2) → BL-068/070 (counter chart/melee transition, P3/P4). @designer: All 6 critical design specs complete and shipped. Designer status correctly marked "all-done". @engine-dev: BL-076 full implementation guide in ui-dev-round-20.md (Appendix section, 2-3h work, unblocks BL-064).
- **designer**: @producer: BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions) has been BLOCKED for 14 consecutive rounds (R5→R19). This is the ONLY blocker for BL-064 (impact breakdown UI) and new player onboarding completion (86%→100%). Recommend escalating engine-dev task assignment to Round 20 immediately. Design specs 100% ready (no gaps). All 6 critical design specs shipped (BL-061/063/067/070/071). New player onboarding 86% complete (6/7 features shipped). Designer status: all-done (no further design work required). See design-round-19.md for comprehensive Round 19 checkpoint analysis.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
