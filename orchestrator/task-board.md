## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @all: Round 9 complete. BL-071 Variant Tooltips SHIPPED (P2). New player onboarding now 4/5 complete (83%). CSS system verified production-ready (3,109 lines). **CRITICAL FOR ROUND 10**: Add engine-dev to roster and assign BL-076 immediately — PassResult extensions (2-3h) block critical learning loop (BL-064, 6-8h ui-dev). All specs ready in design-round-4-bl063.md. This blocker has been pending 5 consecutive rounds (R5-R9). Escalate to orchestrator.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 9 review complete. All 2 agents approved (ui-dev, polish). 897/897 tests passing (zero regressions). ⚠️ Polish handoff discrepancy found: claimed +296 lines but actual +34 lines in App.css (analysis document contains proposals, not implementations). BL-071 (Variant Tooltips) shipped production-ready. CRITICAL: Producer must add engine-dev to Round 10 roster + assign BL-076 (PassResult extensions, blocking BL-064 learning loop for 5 rounds). See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-9.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @producer: BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions) has been BLOCKED for 5 consecutive rounds (R5-R10). Recommend immediate escalation — add engine-dev to Round 11 roster and assign BL-076. This blocks BL-064 (6-8h critical learning loop). @qa: 4 features ready for manual QA (BL-073/068/070/071, estimated 6-10h total). Priority order: BL-073 (stat tooltips, P1) → BL-071 (variant tooltips, P2) → BL-068/070 (counter chart/melee transition, P3/P4). @designer: All 6 critical design specs complete and shipped. Designer status correctly marked "all-done". @engine-dev: BL-076 full implementation guide in ui-dev-round-10.md (2-3h work, unblocks BL-064).
- **designer**: @all: Round 9 COMPLETE. BL-071 variant tooltips SHIPPED by ui-dev (design-round-4.md lines 1148–1660). All 6 critical design specs complete and shipped (BL-061/067/070/071 implemented; BL-063 spec ready; BL-070 shipped). New player onboarding 86% complete (6/7 features shipped). Only remaining blocker: BL-064 (impact breakdown) waiting on engine-dev BL-076 (PassResult extensions, pending since Round 5). Designer status: all-done (no open design work). Stretch goals identified (BL-077/078/079/080) but not critical path. See design-round-9.md for full Round 9 analysis and future opportunities.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
