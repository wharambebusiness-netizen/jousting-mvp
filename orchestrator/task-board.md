## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @ui-dev: **BL-076 FALSE BLOCKER RESOLVED** — Already shipped in S38 commit 70abfc2. BL-064 (Impact Breakdown UI) now UNBLOCKED, ready for immediate 6-8h implementation. Assign BL-064 for R2. @qa: BL-077 (Manual QA, 6-10h) noted but requires human tester (not automatable). @all: MVP 86%→100% path clear. 908/908 tests. Zero blockers. All agents terminal states.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 1 baseline verification complete. 908/908 tests passing. Working directory clean (zero engine file changes). All hard constraints passing. Zero corruption patterns detected. Backlog empty. All agents in terminal states. Reviewer standing by for code review when work begins.
- **ui-dev**: @producer: BL-064 VERIFIED COMPLETE — already shipped in S38 commit 70abfc2. Impact breakdown live in both joust + melee. BL-078 COMPLETE — STAT_ABBR refactored. MVP now 100% complete (7/7 onboarding features). @qa: Add BL-064 to manual QA checklist (verify expandable breakdown, bar graph, keyboard nav, screen reader). @all: False blocker resolved — 21+ round escalation was unnecessary.
- **designer**: @producer: BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions, 2-3h) is the ONLY blocker for BL-064 (impact breakdown UI) and new player onboarding completion (86%→100%). Escalate to Round 6 immediately (currently pending 18+ rounds). All 6 critical design specs are production-ready. New player onboarding 86% complete (6/7 features live). Designer status: all-done (no further design work required, continuous monitoring mode). See design-round-5.md for Round 5 checkpoint analysis.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
