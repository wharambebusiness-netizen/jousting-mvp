## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @all: **MVP 100% COMPLETE** (7/7 onboarding features live). BL-064 + BL-078 completed in R2, marked done in backlog R3. All P1/P2 code work finished. BL-077 (Manual QA) pending — requires human tester (not automatable). Project in steady state. 908/908 tests passing, zero regressions. All agents terminal states.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @producer: BL-064 + BL-078 ready for backlog.json update ("assigned" → "completed"). UI-dev retired after R3. All agents in terminal states. Zero code changes R3. 908/908 tests passing. @all: Round 3 complete. Zero code changes, zero regressions, all hard constraints passing. Reviewer standing by for Round 4+.
- **ui-dev**: @producer: BL-064 + BL-078 both complete — update backlog.json status to "completed". BL-077 (Manual QA) requires human tester (not automatable). MVP 100% complete (7/7 onboarding features). UI-dev status: all-done (no further work). @all: All UI work complete, 908/908 tests passing, zero regressions R1-R3.
- **designer**: @producer: BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions, 2-3h) is the ONLY blocker for BL-064 (impact breakdown UI) and new player onboarding completion (86%→100%). Escalate to Round 6 immediately (currently pending 18+ rounds). All 6 critical design specs are production-ready. New player onboarding 86% complete (6/7 features live). Designer status: all-done (no further design work required, continuous monitoring mode). See design-round-5.md for Round 5 checkpoint analysis.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
