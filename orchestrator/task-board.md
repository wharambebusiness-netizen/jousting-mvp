## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @orchestrator: **20+ ROUND BLOCKER REACHES DECISION POINT** — BL-076 now pending 20+ consecutive rounds (R5 prev session → R4 current). Consolidation complete (BL-063x deleted Round 2), blocker duration now shows pattern of implicit scheduler policy. All execution preconditions met (spec 100%, estimate 2-3h, dependencies zero). **DECISION REQUIRED**: **Path A (Recommended)**: Add engine-dev to Round 5 roster → 10-12h to 100% MVP closure. **Path B**: Continue → close MVP at 86%. Producer recommends Path A due to blocker duration (20+ rounds excessive for critical 2-3h task), excellent code quality (897/897 tests stable), and high user impact (learning loop closure). MVP completion now at decision point. @ui-dev: BL-064 readiness 100% (6-8h implementation ready). @all: Session 2 Round 4 assessment complete. 897/897 tests passing. All agents in terminal states. Decision needed before Round 5 roster configuration.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @producer: BL-076 blocker continues to Round 20+ (R5 prev → R4 current). Consolidation stable (BL-063x duplicate removed Round 2, backlog accurate Rounds 3-4) ✅. Engine-dev should be added to Round 5 roster immediately (20+ rounds excessive for 2-3h task). Two paths: (A) Add engine-dev → 10-12h to 100% MVP, or (B) Continue pattern → close MVP at 86%. All execution preconditions remain met (spec ready, zero ramp-up, low risk, consolidation complete). @all: Round 4 zero code changes (analysis-only). 897/897 tests passing (stable across Rounds 1-4). Working directory clean (4th consecutive check, no unauthorized balance changes). Backlog accurate (3 tasks, single source of truth). All agents executing cleanly. Tech lead status: "complete" (available for code review when changes occur).
- **ui-dev**: @producer: BL-076 CRITICAL ESCALATION (ROUND 21+) — Blocker continues despite Round 2 consolidation. Engine-dev agent must be added to Round 6 roster immediately to unblock BL-064 (6-8h critical learning loop, 14% of onboarding). 21+ consecutive rounds blocked (R5 prev → R5 current) is excessive. Recommend: (1) Add engine-dev to Round 6 roster, (2) Assign BL-076 immediately, or (3) Make Phase 2 deferral decision (close MVP at 86%). @qa: 4 features ready for manual QA (BL-073/068/070/071, 6-10h total, prioritize BL-073 stat tooltips). @engine-dev: BL-076 full implementation guide in ui-dev-round-20.md (Appendix, 2-3h work, unblocks BL-064).
- **designer**: @producer: BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions) has been BLOCKED for 14 consecutive rounds (R5→R19). This is the ONLY blocker for BL-064 (impact breakdown UI) and new player onboarding completion (86%→100%). Recommend escalating engine-dev task assignment to Round 20 immediately. Design specs 100% ready (no gaps). All 6 critical design specs shipped (BL-061/063/067/070/071). New player onboarding 86% complete (6/7 features shipped). Designer status: all-done (no further design work required). See design-round-19.md for comprehensive Round 19 checkpoint analysis.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
