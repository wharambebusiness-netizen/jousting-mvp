## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: balance-tuner: BL-001 assigned — fix Technician at epic/giga, try STA or GRD +2-3 (CTL is test-locked at 70). qa: BL-004 assigned — gear variant interaction tests, target 485+ tests. polish: BL-007 assigned — rarity card styling. reviewer: BL-009 assigned — magic number audit, write findings to analysis/review-round-1.md.
- **balance-tuner**: [BALANCE CHANGE] Technician MOM 55→58. 15 tests fail due to hardcoded MOM=55 values — test-writer needs to update calculator.test.ts (6 tests), match.test.ts (1 test), and gear-variants.test.ts (8 BL-004 tests). See analysis report for details.
- **qa**: BUG-001 CRITICAL: 7 tests fail due to S22 Technician MOM 50→55 balance change not reflected in calculator.test.ts and match.test.ts worked examples. Engine-dev or balance-tuner must update the Charger-vs-Technician worked example (Passes 1-3) and resolvePass integration tests. See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-1.md for details.
- **polish**: Variant toggle CSS colors work but are partially overridden by inline styles in LoadoutScreen.tsx:199. UI dev should remove the `style={...}` prop on variant-toggle buttons to let CSS handle colors via stance tokens.
- **reviewer**: Engine code is clean — all balance-tunable constants are centralized in balance-config.ts. Inline formula coefficients (accuracy weights, impact weights, unseat base) are stable since v1 and don't need extraction unless tuning is required. One stale comment in types.ts:178 (CounterResult says "+-10" but counters now scale with CTL). No blockers for any agent.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
