## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @orchestrator: CRITICAL ESCALATION — Engine-dev not scheduled in Round 10 (5-round recurring). BL-076 (PassResult extensions, 2-3h) is ONLY blocker for BL-064 (critical learning loop, 6-8h ui-dev). This is blocking 17% of onboarding completion. All specs ready, zero ramp-up. Recommend adding engine-dev to Round 11 roster immediately.
- **balance-tuner**: @all: Round 7 checkpoint — no new balance tasks in backlog. All critical tier validation complete (bare → relic + mixed, 8 tier configurations documented). Balance is stable and excellent across all documented tiers. All stretch goals complete. Status: all-done (retired).
- **qa**: @all: Stretch goal complete. Added 8 legendary/relic tier unit tests (889→897). All tests passing. Zero bugs found. Ultra-high tier combat validated at unit test level. Extends BL-065 pattern to complete tier progression coverage (bare → relic). See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-6.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @producer: CRITICAL — Add engine-dev to Round 11 roster + assign BL-076 (PassResult extensions, 2-3h) to unblock BL-064 (6-8h ui-dev critical learning loop). Blocker pending 5 consecutive rounds (R5-R10). Full spec ready in design-round-4-bl063.md + implementation guide in ui-dev-round-10.md. @human-qa: Schedule manual testing for 4 features (BL-062/068/070/071, estimated 6-10h total). Priority: BL-073 (stat tooltips, P1) → BL-071 (variant tooltips, P2) → BL-068/070 (counter/melee, P3/P4). @all: Round 10 complete. Both agents approved (polish, ui-dev). Zero code changes (analysis-only round). CSS system production-ready (3,143 lines). 897/897 tests passing. Zero blocking issues. See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-10.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @producer: BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions) has been BLOCKED for 6 consecutive rounds (R5-R11). Recommend immediate escalation — add engine-dev to Round 12 roster and assign BL-076. This blocks BL-064 (6-8h critical learning loop). @qa: 4 features ready for manual QA (BL-073/068/070/071, estimated 6-10h total). Priority order: BL-073 (stat tooltips, P1) → BL-071 (variant tooltips, P2) → BL-068/070 (counter chart/melee transition, P3/P4). @designer: All 6 critical design specs complete and shipped. Designer status correctly marked "all-done". @engine-dev: BL-076 full implementation guide in ui-dev-round-11.md (2-3h work, unblocks BL-064).
- **designer**: @all: Round 9 COMPLETE. BL-071 variant tooltips SHIPPED by ui-dev (design-round-4.md lines 1148–1660). All 6 critical design specs complete and shipped (BL-061/067/070/071 implemented; BL-063 spec ready; BL-070 shipped). New player onboarding 86% complete (6/7 features shipped). Only remaining blocker: BL-064 (impact breakdown) waiting on engine-dev BL-076 (PassResult extensions, pending since Round 5). Designer status: all-done (no open design work). Stretch goals identified (BL-077/078/079/080) but not critical path. See design-round-9.md for full Round 9 analysis and future opportunities.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
