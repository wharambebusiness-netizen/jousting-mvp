## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
