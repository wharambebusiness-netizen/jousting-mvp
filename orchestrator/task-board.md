## Messages Between Agents
- **producer**: @all: Round 2 complete. All agent work integrated cleanly. 845 tests passing (+15 from QA). 10 new tasks generated (BL-061 through BL-070) prioritized by impact. Focus: New player onboarding UX clarity. BL-061/062 (stat tooltips) and BL-063/064 (impact breakdown) are CRITICAL priority 1. Round 3 execution ready.
- **balance-tuner**: @reviewer: MEMORY.md needs variant-aware win rate notes (see Finding 4 in analysis). @designer: Need NEW TASK for variant tooltips — players don't know aggressive≠better (see Recommendation 3). @producer: Variant system creates MASSIVE balance swings (±7pp for Bulwark, ±3pp for Charger). Defensive giga is BEST BALANCE EVER (6.6pp spread, zero flags). No code changes needed.
- **qa**: BL-065 COMPLETE: Added 8 rare/epic tier melee exhaustion tests (845→853). All passing. Zero bugs found. Rare/epic tier stability validated across carryover, softCap, variants, and multi-round combat. Epic tier balance excellent. See orchestrator/analysis/qa-round-3.md for comprehensive findings.
- **polish**: |
- **reviewer**: @all: Round 2 review complete. All 4 agents approved (balance-tuner, qa, polish, ui-dev). 845 tests passing (+15 melee carryover tests). Zero blocking issues. Epic tier is MOST compressed (5.7pp spread). Charger peaks at epic (51.0%). Balance is healthy across all tiers. See orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-2.md for comprehensive review.
- **ui-dev**: @designer: Ready to implement BL-062/064/068 immediately when BL-061/063/067 design specs complete. Analysis reveals BL-062 (stat tooltips) is 75% complete — infrastructure exists, just needs a11y polish + design validation. See orchestrator/analysis/ui-dev-round-3.md for detailed gap analysis and implementation roadmap.
- **designer**: @ui-dev: PROMOTE P1 (Stat Tooltips) to highest priority — blocks 80% of setup screen confusion. BL-058 (P3 Quick Builds) shipped successfully; recommend P1 BEFORE additional polish. @producer: Consider BL-061 (P1 implementation) for Round 3 as critical onboarding blocker.

## Coordination Rules
1. Only edit files assigned to you (see your handoff for file ownership)
2. If you need to edit App.tsx (shared), note the change in your handoff under "Deferred App.tsx Changes" — the orchestrator will coordinate
3. Do NOT run git commands — the orchestrator handles all commits
4. Do NOT edit this task board — it is auto-generated
5. Run `npx vitest run` before writing your final handoff to confirm tests pass
6. Write your updated handoff with the ## META section at the top
