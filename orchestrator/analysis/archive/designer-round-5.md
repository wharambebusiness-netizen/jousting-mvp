# Game Designer — Round 5 Checkpoint Analysis

**Round**: 5 (Fresh Session Round After S54 Completion)
**Status**: ✅ **VERIFICATION ONLY** — Zero new design work
**Test Result**: ✅ **908/908 PASSING**
**Time**: ~2 minutes verification

---

## Verification Summary

### MVP Completion Status ✅
- **MVP Status**: 100% COMPLETE (stable from R50 S54)
- **Tests**: 908/908 passing (verified fresh)
- **All 7/7 onboarding features**: Live and shipped
  1. ✅ Stat Tooltips (BL-061)
  2. ✅ Quick Builds (BL-058)
  3. ✅ Variant Tooltips (BL-071)
  4. ✅ Counter Chart (BL-067)
  5. ✅ Melee Transition Explainer (BL-070)
  6. ✅ Impact Breakdown (BL-064)
  7. ✅ Learning loop integration (implicit)

### Round 5 Findings
- **Test count**: 908/908 (verified: `npm test` run successful)
- **Code changes since R50**: ZERO (clean state)
- **Regressions**: NONE
- **Hard constraints**: ALL PASSING

### Designer Workload Assessment

**Backlog Status**:
- BL-082 (Archetype Feel & Identity, P3) — **PENDING**, awaiting producer priority
  - Priority: P3 (post-MVP polish, Phase 2 work)
  - Estimate: 3-4 hours
  - Scope: 6 archetype specs (identity, strategies, teaching)
  - Status: **DEFERRED** per S54 producer guidance

**No critical design work remaining**:
- All MVP critical specs complete (BL-061, BL-063, BL-067, BL-070, BL-071)
- All critical onboarding gaps closed (stat clarity, gear decisions, counter learning, phase transitions, pass result feedback)
- MVP is production-ready for Phase 2 planning

---

## Designer Status Continuation

**Round 5 Recommendation**: `all-done` — designer remains terminal until:

1. **Producer explicitly prioritizes BL-082**, OR
2. **Phase 2 kick-off approved** (at which point new design work emerges), OR
3. **New critical issues flagged** (e.g., game feel problems, learning curve issues, balance asymmetries causing design concerns)

**Current role**: Monitoring/standby mode. Designer verified no regressions, zero code drift, MVP stability maintained.

---

## Session Continuity Notes

**S54 → S54 Fresh Round 5**:
- Handoff R50 confirmed S54 complete
- 50 rounds of stable zero-change iterations
- All agents terminal at session end
- Fresh Round 5 continuation is standard orchestrator behavior (continuous agent pool)

**No action needed** — Designer ready to:
- Execute BL-082 if prioritized
- Support Phase 2 onboarding enhancements if approved
- Remain on standby if no new design tasks assigned

---

## Summary

✅ **MVP 100% complete** (verified)
✅ **908/908 tests passing** (verified)
✅ **All 7/7 features shipped** (verified)
✅ **Zero regressions** (verified)
🔴 **No critical design work for Round 5+** (awaiting producer or Phase 2 signal)
⏳ **BL-082 pending** (P3 stretch goal, deferred to Phase 2)

**Designer Status**: `all-done` (continuous, standby)
