## What Was Done

### Round 5 (Fresh Session) — BL-082 Execution (P3 Stretch Goal)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** — BL-082 delivered

**Task**: Orchestrator backlog assigned BL-082 (Priority 3 stretch goal) with no dependencies. Designer executed as continuous role.

**Activity**:
1. Verified 908/908 tests passing (stable from previous session)
2. Read CLAUDE.md archetype stats (post-S52 zero-flags balance)
3. Analyzed attack system (joust + melee counters, stances, delta modifiers)
4. Designed 6 comprehensive archetype identity specs with:
   - **Identity statements** (core feeling, key strengths/weaknesses)
   - **Signature strategies** (3 per archetype × 2 phases = 6 total per archetype)
   - **Teaching progressions** (Level 1-5 learning curve)
   - **Implementation notes** (Phase 2 integration points)
   - **Quick reference decision tree** (archetype selection guide)

**Deliverable**: `orchestrator/analysis/bl-082-archetype-identity.md` (NEW, ~2,000 lines)
- **Charger**: Raw impact specialist (Momentum 75, Stamina 65) — Blitz, Sustain, Finisher strategies
- **Technician**: Reactive control master (Control 70, Initiative 59) — Shift Master, Control Spiral, Long Game strategies
- **Bulwark**: Defensive wall (Guard 64, Stamina 62) — Turtle, Counter-Attack, Patience Game strategies
- **Tactician**: Tempo control (Initiative 75, Control 65) — Blitz Master, Tempo Shift, Tempo Trap strategies
- **Breaker**: Guard penetration (Guard Penetration 0.25, Stamina 62) — Penetrator, Relentless, Anti-Bulwark strategies
- **Duelist**: Balanced generalist (all 60s) — Flexible Fighter, Anti-Specialist, Long Game strategies

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ All 6 archetypes have distinct playstyles already (no mechanics changes needed)
- ✅ Signature strategies emerge naturally from S52 stat distribution
- ✅ Teaching curve fits 5-level progression (Tutorial → Mastery)
- ✅ Each archetype has 2-3 joust + 2 melee signature strategies
- ✅ Counter-dynamics visible in archetype matchups (Breaker > Bulwark, Charger > Technician in joust, etc.)

**Design Scope** (no balance changes):
- Identity statements + playstyle descriptions only
- Signature strategies derived from existing stats/attacks
- Teaching progressions (when/where to teach concepts)
- Implementation hints for Phase 2 (tooltips, flavor text, narrative)

**Impact on MVP**:
- No code changes
- No balance changes (S52 zero-flags preserved)
- No mechanical changes
- Pure design documentation (Phase 2 reference material)

**Summary**: BL-082 (P3 stretch goal) completed successfully. Comprehensive archetype identity framework ready for Phase 2 polish (narrative, tooltips, learning curve optimization). All 908/908 tests passing. Designer returning to all-done standby.

### Round 5 (S54) — MVP Completion Verification + Status Update

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** — Verification-only round, no design work required

**Task**: Continuous monitoring of all-done designer role + verify MVP completion status (clarify "86% or 100%?" confusion)

**Deliverable**: `orchestrator/analysis/design-round-5-s54.md` (NEW) — Round 5 verification analysis documenting:
- ✅ **Confirmed MVP is 100% complete** (not 86% as R19 analysis suggested)
- ✅ Verified BL-064 (impact breakdown) already shipped in commit 70abfc2 ("feat: impact breakdown for joust + melee (BL-076 + BL-064)")
- ✅ All 7/7 onboarding clarity features shipped and live
- ✅ Verified 908/908 tests passing (897→908 tests in S54 R1, QA added 8 legendary/relic tier tests)
- ✅ ImpactBreakdownCard component found in src/ui/PassResult.tsx and src/ui/MeleeResult.tsx — fully functional
- ✅ No regression, all hard constraints passing
- 📋 BL-082 (archetype identity, P3 stretch) deferred to Phase 2 (lower priority than variant tuning)

**Summary**:
Round 5 is a **verification checkpoint** for S54 new session baseline. Key finding: MVP is already **100% complete**, contradicting the R19 analysis which said "86% (6/7 features, BL-064 blocked)."

Investigation revealed:
- Design-round-19.md written before BL-064 was actually shipped
- Commit 70abfc2 ("feat: impact breakdown for joust + melee") shipped BOTH BL-076 (engine) and BL-064 (UI) together
- ImpactBreakdownCard is fully implemented and used in both joust and melee phases
- S54 R1 added 8 legendary/relic tier tests (897→908)

**MVP Status**:
- ✅ All 6 critical design specs COMPLETE and SHIPPED
- ✅ All 7/7 onboarding features LIVE:
  1. ✅ Stat Tooltips (BL-061/062, R4)
  2. ✅ Quick Builds (BL-058, R2)
  3. ✅ Variant Tooltips (BL-071, R9)
  4. ✅ Counter Chart (BL-067/068, R6–R7)
  5. ✅ Melee Transition Explainer (BL-070, R8)
  6. ✅ Impact Breakdown (BL-064, prior session via commit 70abfc2)
  7. ✅ [Implicit] Pass result learning loop enabled by impact breakdown

**Test Status**: 908/908 passing (verified before handoff, +11 tests from R1 QA work)

**Designer Activity**:
1. Read session-changelog.md (comprehensive R1–R4 history)
2. Read task-board.md (agent status, files modified)
3. Read current handoff (noted "897/897" discrepancy)
4. Ran full test suite: ✅ 908/908 passing
5. Searched git history for BL-064 confirmation (found commit 70abfc2)
6. Verified ImpactBreakdownCard implementation in PassResult.tsx + MeleeResult.tsx
7. Clarified MVP completion status (100%, not 86%)
8. Created design-round-5-s54.md checkpoint analysis
9. Updated handoff with verified facts

**Key Insight**: The "86% vs 100%" confusion arose because:
- R19 analysis (prior session) was written BEFORE BL-064 implementation
- BL-064 was shipped in a later session (commit 70abfc2)
- R1 producer assumed "engine-dev NOT in roster" meant BL-064 wouldn't be done, but it was already shipped
- MVP is actually **100% complete and has been since commit 70abfc2**

**Next Steps for Producer**:
- ✅ Update status dashboard: MVP 100% (was 86%)
- ⏳ **BL-082 (archetype identity)** — assign to designer ONLY if Phase 2 kick-off approved (currently deferred)
- ⏳ **BL-079 (variant balance sweep)** — assign to balance-tuner (P1 blocker for BL-080)
- ⏳ **BL-077 (manual QA)** — requires human tester resource
- ⏳ **BL-083 (legendary/relic deep dive)** — assign to balance-tuner (stretch goal)
