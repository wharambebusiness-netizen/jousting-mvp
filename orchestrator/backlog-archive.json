Can a player FEEL the difference between all-aggressive and all-defensive loadouts?\n2. Are there interesting variant combinations? (e.g., aggressive lance + defensive armor for a specific matchup strategy)\n3. Is the UI clear enough for players to understand what each variant does?\n4. Should variant choice interact with archetype selection? (e.g., aggressive gear on a Bulwark — is that a fun contrarian build or just suboptimal?)\n5. Propose any improvements to make variant selection more engaging.\n\nRead src/engine/gigling-gear.ts, src/engine/player-gear.ts, and the gear variant test data.
