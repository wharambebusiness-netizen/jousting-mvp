    "description": "✅ COMPLETED Round 9: Variant strategy tooltips designed (design-round-4.md lines 1148-1660) and implemented by ui-dev (shipped Round 9).\n\nDesign deliverable: 514-line design spec covering:\n- Aggressive: Strategy, risk, impact descriptions\n- Balanced: Neutral baseline positioning\n- Defensive: Best overall balance positioning\n- All 3 with emoji icons (⚡, ✓, ⛑️) and impact metrics\n\nUI implementation: Inline tooltips on Quick Build cards (persistent display, always visible). Mobile responsive (stacked layout ≤480px). Accessible (aria-labels, semantic HTML).\n\nImpact: Players now understand variant choice = strategic depth (±2.6pp = 3+ rarity tiers). Prevents sub-optimization (e.g., Charger players now see Defensive +2.9pp advantage).\n\nTest status: 897/897 passing (zero regressions). Manual QA pending for cross-browser/screen reader/responsive validation (1-2h estimated).",
