Without tooltips, players may optimize for wrong variant (e.g., aggressive Charger at giga is WORSE than defensive +2.9pp).\n\n**Solution**: Add variant tooltips on gear selection screen explaining strategic impact:\n- **Aggressive**: \"Higher offense, lower defense. Favors quick unseats and melee. Riskier stamina. ±6pp swing at giga.\"\n- **Balanced**: \"Equal offense and defense. Reliable for all playstyles.

    "description": "CRITICAL BLOCKER: BL-064 (ui-dev impact breakdown implementation) blocked on PassResult schema extension.\n\n**Scope**: Add 9 optional fields to PassResult interface to support impact breakdown UI.\n\n**Fields needed** (from design-round-4-bl063.md Section 5):\n1. counterWon: boolean (did player win counter?)\n2. counterBonus: number (+4 or -4 impact from counter win/loss)\n3. guardStrength: number (your guard stat before reduction)\n4. guardReduction: number (how much guard absorbed damage)\n5. fatiguePercent: number (current stamina % at end of pass)\n6. momPenalty: number (MOM reduced by fatigue)\n7. ctlPenalty: number (CTL reduced by fatigue)\n8. maxStaminaTracker: number (for fatigue calculation context)\n9. breakerPenetrationUsed: boolean (if opponent is Breaker)\n\n**Files to modify**:\n- src/engine/types.ts (PassResult interface — add optional fields)\n- src/engine/calculator.ts (resolveJoustPass — populate fields with actual values)\n- src/engine/phase-joust.ts (ensure fields exported correctly)\n\n**Test requirements**:\n- All existing tests still pass (889+)\n- New field values match impact breakdown design templates\n- Fields optional (backwards compatible with existing code)\n- No test assertions need updates (all fields optional)\n\n**Acceptance criteria**:\n- PassResult fields added to types.ts with TSDoc comments\n- calculator.ts resolveJoustPass populates all 9 fields\n- All 889+ tests passing with zero regressions\n- BL-064 unblocked (ui-dev can implement immediately)\n\nEstimate: 2-3 hours\nBlocks: BL-064 (6-8h ui-dev impact breakdown)\nDepends on: BL-063 design spec (complete)\n\n**Detailed specs**: orchestrator/analysis/design-round-4-bl063.md (Section 5, lines 410-448)",
