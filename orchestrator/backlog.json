    "description": "Implement impact breakdown display on pass result screens. Shows momentum component, accuracy component, guard penalty, counter bonus for each pass. Closes final 14% MVP gap (7/7 onboarding features complete). Design spec complete (design-round-5.md). PassResult extensions shipped in S38 commit 70abfc2 (BL-076). Ready to implement immediately. Acceptance: Impact breakdown visible on joust + melee result screens, explains all 4 impact components, helps players understand why they won/lost.",
