    "description": "CRITICAL: 7 tests fail due to balance-tuner's Technician MOM change (55→58) in round 1. Tests that need updated assertions:\n\n1. calculator.test.ts — 'Technician pre-shift stats are below knee (unchanged)' — expects MOM=55, actual=58\n2. calculator.test.ts — 'Technician post-shift has slight fatigue (sta 43 < threshold 44)' — cascading from MOM change\n3. calculator.test.ts — 'Technician stats use correct fatigue' — MOM: 50*ff should be 58*ff (note: old test used MOM=50 from pre-S22)\n4. calculator.test.ts — 'Technician stats at deeper fatigue' — MOM: 60*ff should be 63*ff (58+CEP.delta=5)\n5. calculator.test.ts — 'resolves Pass 1 with correct directional outcome' — Charger may no longer win impact against Technician\n6. calculator.test.ts — 'counter bonus in resolvePass scales with CTL' — impact delta sign flipped\n7. match.test.ts — 'replays Charger vs Technician Passes 1-3 via match machine' — pass 1 impact direction wrong\n\nRecalculate all expected values using Technician MOM=58, CTL=70, GRD=55, INIT=60, STA=55. For tests 5-7: the Charger vs Technician impact comparison has tightened — Technician's higher MOM (58 vs 55) means Charger's MOM advantage (75 vs 58) is reduced, potentially flipping directional assertions. You may need to change assertion direction or use closeTo() for tight margins.\n\nAcceptance criteria: All 589 tests pass (582+7 fixed). Run `npx vitest run` to confirm.",
