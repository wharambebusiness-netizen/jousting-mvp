Are stat labels (MOM/CTL/GRD/INIT/STA) clear?\n2. Loadout screen: Is gear/rarity/variant selection overwhelming? What could be simplified for first-timers?\n3. Speed selection: Do they understand the speed/power tradeoff?\n4. Attack selection: Can they learn the counter system? Are hints sufficient?\n5. Pass results: Can they understand what happened and WHY they won/lost?\n6. Melee phase: Is the transition clear? Do they understand the new attack set?\n\nPropose improvements focused on CLARITY, not dumbing down.
