Test plan includes screen readers (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver), cross-browser (Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge), touch devices (iOS/Android), accessibility (WCAG AAA), responsive layouts (320px-1920px). Cannot be automated by AI agent — requires human tester. Acceptance: All 4 features verified across 3 browsers, 2 screen readers, 1 mobile device. Zero accessibility issues.",
