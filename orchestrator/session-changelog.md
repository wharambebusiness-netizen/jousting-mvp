Reviewer standing by for code review when work begins.
- **producer** (OK): files=[orchestrator/analysis/producer-round-1.md (NEW), orchestrator/backlog.json (updated)], tests=PASS. @ui-dev: **BL-076 FALSE BLOCKER RESOLVED** — Already shipped in S38 commit 70abfc2. BL-064 (Impact Breakdown UI) now UNBLOCKED, ready for immediate 6-8h implementation. Assign BL-064 for R2. @qa: BL-077 (Manual QA, 6-10h) noted but requires human tester (not automatable). @all: MVP 86%→100% path clear. 908/908 tests. Zero blockers. All agents terminal states.
