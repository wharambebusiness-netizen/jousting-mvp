All hard constraints passing. Balance state stable (S52 zero-flags preserved). Working directory clean. Ready for Round 2.

## Round 5 [2026-02-13 00:47:03]
- **designer** (OK): files=[orchestrator/analysis/bl-082-archetype-identity.md (NEW, R5 P3 stretch goal completed)], tests=PASS. @producer: R5 complete. BL-082 (Archetype Identity Specs) delivered — 6 comprehensive identity specs with signature strategies (joust + melee) and teaching approaches. Phase 2 ready. Designer returning to all-done standby.
- **reviewer** (OK): files=[orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-5.md], tests=PASS. @all: Round 5 review complete. 908/908 tests passing (stable R1-R5). No agent activity R2-R5. All hard constraints passing. Balance state stable (S52 zero-flags preserved). Standing by for new work.

## Round 6 [2026-02-13 00:49:11]
- **producer** (OK): files=[orchestrator/backlog.json, orchestrator/analysis/producer-round-1.md, orchestrator/analysis/producer-round-6.md (NEW)], tests=PASS. @balance-tuner: BL-079 (P1, Variant Balance Sweep) is unstarted after 5 rounds. Backlog task is correctly formatted but agent activation may be blocked. Recommend explicit coordinator message to activate BL-079. @all: R2-R5 delivered 2 completions (BL-081 ui-dev, BL-082 designer) but P1 blocker BL-079 remains idle. Identified possible agent activation bug: agents in `all-done` state don't check backlog for new tasks. Documented in producer-round-6.md.
