# Session Changelog (auto-generated)

## Round 1 [2026-02-10 21:32:23]
- **engine-refactor** (OK): files=[none], tests=PASS. @gear-system: Engine is stable, all impact breakdown fields populated in phase-joust.ts and phase-melee.ts — no blockers from engine side. @quality-review: Working directory clean (git diff src/engine/archetypes.ts and balance-config.ts both empty). 908/908 tests passing. @all: BL-076 + BL-064 were already shipped in commit 70abfc2 (S38). ImpactBreakdown interface in types.ts:119-134, populated in phase-joust.ts:213-259 and phase-melee.ts:111-148. No engine work remaining.
- **quality-review** (OK): files=[CLAUDE.md, orchestrator/analysis/quality-review-round-1.md], tests=PASS. @engine-refactor: Working directory clean on engine files — archetypes.ts and balance-config.ts match last commit. 908/908 tests passing. CLAUDE.md updated (test counts corrected: gear-variants 215→223, quick-ref 897→908, session ref S35R6→S38). simulate.ts refactoring looks clean (exports + --json flag, backwards compatible). @all: No code changes to review yet (Round 1). All previous agents retired (all-done). Backlog is empty.

## Round 2 [2026-02-10 21:33:40]
- **gear-system** (OK): files=[none], tests=PASS. @ui-loadout: Gear system is fully implemented and stable. 6 steed slots (chamfron, barding, saddle, stirrups, reins, horseshoes) + 6 player slots (helm, shield, lance, armor, gauntlets, melee_weapon). 3 gear variants (aggressive, balanced, defensive) per slot. All API functions working: createStatGear, createFullLoadout, createPlayerGear, createFullPlayerLoadout — all accept optional variant param. ImpactBreakdown populated in phase-joust.ts and phase-melee.ts (BL-076/BL-064 shipped). No engine-side blockers. @quality-review: No files modified this round — gear system was already complete from prior sessions.
- **quality-review** (OK): files=[orchestrator/analysis/quality-review-round-2.md], tests=PASS. @all: 908/908 tests passing. No code changes to review in Round 2 — engine-refactor retired, gear-system not yet started. Working directory clean (only task-board.md diff, orchestrator-managed). Ready to review gear-system output when it lands.

## Round 3 [2026-02-10 21:39:36]
- **ui-loadout** (OK): files=[src/ui/MatchSummary.tsx, src/ui/MeleeResult.tsx, src/ui/SetupScreen.tsx, src/App.css], tests=PASS. @quality-review: Fixed a real bug in MatchSummary LoadoutMini — stat abbreviations used `.slice(0,3).toUpperCase()` which produced wrong labels (control→CON instead of CTL, guard→GUA instead of GRD, initiative→INI instead of INIT). Now uses proper STAT_ABBR mapping. Also replaced all P1/P2 labels across MatchSummary and MeleeResult with "You"/"Opp" + archetype names for readability. Added archetype hint cards (strengths + gameplay tip) to SetupScreen for new player onboarding (addresses MEMORY.md P1 gap). @all: No engine files modified. No App.tsx changes needed.
- **quality-review** (OK): files=[orchestrator/analysis/quality-review-round-3.md], tests=PASS. @all: 908/908 tests passing. Working directory clean. 3rd consecutive round with zero code changes — all feature agents either retired or not started. gear-system handoff verified (complete, zero files modified). ui-loadout is unblocked and ready for orchestrator launch.
