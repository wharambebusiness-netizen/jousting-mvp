# Session Changelog (auto-generated)

## Round 1 [2026-02-10 16:56:58]
- **ui-dev** (OK): files=[orchestrator/analysis/ui-dev-round-1.md], tests=PASS. @producer: BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions) has been BLOCKED for 17+ consecutive rounds (R5 prev session → R1 current session). Recommend immediate escalation — add engine-dev to Round 2 roster and assign BL-076. This blocks BL-064 (6-8h critical learning loop). @qa: 4 features ready for manual QA (BL-073/068/070/071, estimated 6-10h total). Priority order: BL-073 (stat tooltips, P1) → BL-071 (variant tooltips, P2) → BL-068/070 (counter chart/melee transition, P3/P4). @designer: All 6 critical design specs complete and shipped. Designer status correctly marked "all-done". @engine-dev: BL-076 full implementation guide in ui-dev-round-20.md (Appendix section, 2-3h work, unblocks BL-064).

## Round 1 [2026-02-10 17:01:20]
- **producer** (OK): files=[orchestrator/analysis/producer-round-1.md (NEW)], tests=PASS. @orchestrator: **17+ ROUND BLOCKER CONTINUES (SCHEDULER DECISION REQUIRED)** — BL-076 (engine-dev PassResult extensions, 2-3h) still not scheduled after 17 consecutive rounds (R5 previous session → R1 current session). This is now a **100% scheduler-level policy decision** (all specs ready, zero ramp-up, all execution preconditions met). **Two paths**: **Path A (Recommended)**: Add engine-dev to Round 2 roster → 10-12h remaining to 100% MVP closure (BL-076 2-3h + BL-064 6-8h). **Path B (Current State)**: Continue with 17-round pattern → close MVP at 86% (6/7 onboarding features). All other work: ✅ Clean (zero execution issues, 897 tests passing, 3,143 CSS production-ready). @ui-dev: BL-064 readiness 100% (6-8h implementation ready, awaiting BL-076). @manual-qa: 4 features ready for human testing (6-10h total, prioritize BL-073 stat tooltips). @all: Session 2 of orchestrator deployment. MVP feature-complete at 86%, design-complete at 100%, code-quality excellent.
- **reviewer** (OK): files=[CLAUDE.md, orchestrator/analysis/reviewer-round-1.md], tests=PASS. @producer: BL-035 complete. CLAUDE.md now documents Technician MOM=64 validation, win rates (bare/epic/giga), tier progression (5.7-22.4pp spread), and variant impact (defensive = best balance 6.6pp). All data validated against N=200 simulations. Zero test regressions. @all: Use CLAUDE.md lines 118-161 as reference for archetype stats and win rates.
