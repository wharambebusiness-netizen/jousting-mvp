| S75 | Orchestrator v29, critical agent pool async bugfix (runAgentPool was async but called without await — agents never properly awaited between rounds), handoff test isolation via ORCH_HANDOFF_DIR env var, coord agent lifecycle test. 1218→1219 tests |
| S76 | Planning: Operator UI system design. 3 review agents (tech feasibility, UX/workflow, Claude Code capabilities). Revised 6-milestone plan: M1 walking skeleton (Agent SDK + auto-continuation CLI), M2 robust session mgmt, M3 agent self-continuation, M4 HTTP API, M5 web UI dashboard, M6 orchestrator mgmt + git. Key decisions: Agent SDK over CLI spawning, build on existing modules, server-rendered HTML over React SPA, cut multi-orchestrator milestone. No code changes. |
| S77 | M1 Walking Skeleton: Installed Agent SDK (v0.2.44), created operator/ directory, built operator.mjs CLI daemon with session chain runner. Features: SDK query() integration, PreCompact hook for context monitoring, handoff parsing from agent output, auto-commit between sessions, chain logging. Tested with 2-turn and 3-turn limits — continuation loop works end-to-end across multiple sessions. |
| S78 | Planning: Reviewed S76 operator milestone plan for technical soundness. Created `docs/operator-plan.md` — comprehensive architecture doc for M2-M6 with schemas, implementation notes, delegation guides. Key revisions: auto-push moved from M6 to M2, M3 requires design spike first, M5 scoped to read-only MVP, process supervision addressed in M2. |
| S79 | Operator M2: Built robust session management. Created registry.mjs (chain persistence with atomic writes, CRUD, archival), errors.mjs (error classification for thrown + in-band SDK errors, retry with backoff, circuit breaker, handoff validation). Rewrote operator.mjs with all M2 features: --resume, --max-budget-usd, --project-dir, --auto-push, --notify-webhook, error recovery, handoff validation+retry. Multi-project ready via --project-dir flag + projectDir in registry. 51 new tests. 1219→1270 tests, 19→21 suites. |
| S80 | Operator M3: Agent self-continuation. Design spike resolved interaction between operator-level and orchestrator-level continuation (they operate at different levels, no conflict). Added runAgentWithContinuation() to sdk-adapter.mjs — wraps runAgentViaSDK() with PreCompact hook, handoff parsing, cost guardrails ($2 default, max 3 continuations). Wired into agent-runner.mjs (conditional SDK path when useSDK=true). Added recordContinuation() to agent-tracking.mjs. New config: maxAgentContinuations, maxAgentChainCostUsd, maxAgentTurns. 28 new tests. 1270→1298 tests, 21→22 suites. |
| S81 | Operator M4: HTTP API layer. Express + WebSocket server (server.mjs, routes/chains.mjs, routes/orchestrator.mjs, ws.mjs). 8 REST endpoints (chain CRUD, costs, projects, orchestrator status/control) + WebSocket event bridge with pattern subscriptions. Multi-project filtering, pagination, CORS. 3 parallel review agents found 8 bugs (WeakMap leak, pagination, req.body crash, signal handlers, etc) — all fixed. 50 new server tests including WS integration with message queue pattern. 1298→1348 tests, 22→23 suites. |
| S82 | Two phases. Phase 1: 3 parallel review agents audited M1-M3 code, found 16 bugs/risks. Fixed 8 bugs: shell injection in git commit (spawn with array args), handoff name collision (chain ID prefix), per-session budget (remaining not total), success always true in continuation, SIGINT/SIGTERM graceful shutdown, orphaned tmp cleanup, NaN budget fallback, original prompt in continuation. 22 new edge case tests. Phase 2: M5 Web UI Dashboard — 3 pages (dashboard, chain detail, orchestrator) with Pico CSS dark mode + HTMX polling. Server-rendered HTML fragments, session timeline, cost breakdown bars, agent cards, quick-start form. 38 view tests. 1348→1408 tests, 23→24 suites. |
| S83 | M6 kickoff. Phase 1: Added web design skills — researched modern dashboard UI patterns, created memory/web-design.md (29-section design reference) and memory/ui-upgrade-plan.md (gap analysis). Phase 2: Surveyed M6 scope (3 parallel agents: M6 spec, existing routes, missions/reports/git-ops). Created 8-task M6 plan. Phase 3: Rewrote operator/public/style.css with professional design token system — Linear/Vercel-inspired dark palette, CSS custom properties, sticky glassmorphism nav, metric cards, semantic status dots/badges, skeleton loading, toast notifications, HTMX transitions, progress bar, breadcrumbs, responsive breakpoints. 212→527 lines CSS. Tests unchanged: 1408 tests, 24 suites. |
| S84 | M6 complete. Step 1: Updated all 3 HTML pages (index, chain, orchestrator) — new glassmorphism nav, .page layout, toast container, progress bar JS, hx-boost, skeleton loading. Step 2: Migrated all view renderer class names — dot→status-dot, badge→badge--variant, timeline-block→timeline__segment, btn-kill→btn btn--danger, stat-card→metric-card, empty-msg→empty-state. Step 3 (M6a): Built mission launcher — GET /api/orchestrator/missions lists JSON configs, POST /api/orchestrator/start forks orchestrator via child_process, mission launcher form with dry-run toggle. Step 4 (M6d): Built git integration — operator/routes/git.mjs with status/push/commit/PR endpoints, git status panel on dashboard with HTMX polling. Updated 5 test assertions for new class names, added 7 new tests for M6 features. 1408→1415 tests, 24 suites. |
| S85 | Three features. (1) Report Viewer (M6b): GET /api/orchestrator/reports + /reports/:file endpoints, /views/report-viewer HTMX fragment with tab-based file switching, markdown rendering via marked CDN. (2) Live Log Streaming: orchestrator:log bridged to WebSocket, log panel on orchestrator page with auto-scroll, clear, 500-line buffer, stderr highlighting, auto-reconnect. (3) Chain Restart: POST /api/chains/:id/restart creates new chain from failed/aborted original, restart buttons on chain rows and detail page. 15 new tests. 1415→1430 tests, 24 suites. |
| S86 | React frontend polish. Fixed 3 bugs: melee win dots showed 3 instead of 4 (AttackSelect + MeleeResult), player labels P1/P2/Opp → You/Opponent for consistency, unseat check excluded 'none' value in MeleeTransitionScreen. Deleted dead MeleeTransition.tsx. Comprehensive 15-component audit identified remaining polish items (reveal animation, hardcoded colors, code duplication). Tests unchanged: 1430 tests, 24 suites. |
| S87 | React frontend polish continued. (1) Dramatic reveal animation: RevealScreen now has 3-phase staged reveal — player attack shows immediately, opponent card flips after 0.8s via CSS 3D perspective transform, counters and action buttons fade in at 1.6s. (2) CounterChart hardcoded colors: replaced #2ECC71/#E74C3C with --counter-win-border/--counter-lose-border design tokens. (3) STAT_TIPS consolidation: exported shared STAT_TIPS from helpers.tsx, removed duplicate from LoadoutScreen.tsx. Tests unchanged: 1430 tests, 24 suites. |
| S88 | React code cleanup + feature polish. (1) Removed 189 lines dead CSS (triangle/matrix/text chart styles and old responsive queries). (2) Replaced 12 hardcoded rgba() values with new stance design tokens (--stance-*-light, --stance-*-glow, --stance-*-shadow, --inset-highlight). (3) Extracted CounterBadge and MeleeWinsTracker components, unified JoustAttackSelect/MeleeAttackSelect into single AttackSelectScreen. (4) Added keyboard arrow navigation for attack grids. (5) Added screen transition animations (fade-out/fade-in with prefers-reduced-motion). (6) Added 360px ultra-small breakpoint. (7) Consolidated 14 useState calls into useReducer with REMATCH reset action. Tests unchanged: 1430 tests, 24 suites. |
| S89 | React polish — design tokens + arrow nav + transitions. (1) Replaced all 26 remaining hardcoded rgba() in App.css with 19 new design tokens (gold-tint, red-tint, overlay, green/blue-tint, parchment-ghost). (2) Added arrow key navigation to speed selection grid (3-col). (3) Added arrow key navigation to reveal screen shift grid (2-col, 5 cards). (4) Fixed screen transition double-click bugs with transitioning guards on all 8+ handlers. (5) Extracted AI choice logic into pure computeJoustAI/computeMeleeAI helper functions. Tests unchanged: 1430 tests, 24 suites. |
| S90 | Operator P1 UX polish — toasts, agent cards, table filtering, report refresh. (1) Created shared app.js with progress bar, showToast(), global API toast listener. (2) Report auto-refresh every 15s. (3) Enriched agent cards with model/duration/cost/continuation badges via per-agent Map tracking. (4) Chain table filtering + sorting with hx-include params. (5) Replaced location.reload() with htmx.trigger() patterns. +7 tests → 1437 tests, 24 suites. |
| S91 | Operator P2 features — model override, report filter, branch auto-gen, PR auto-gen, auto-push. (1) Model tier dropdown in mission launcher (sonnet/opus/haiku) with --model CLI flag pass-through. (2) Report search filter with client-side tab filtering. (3) Branch auto-generation from task description with slugify helper. (4) PR body auto-generation from chain summary on completed chains. (5) Auto-push toggle on git panel with WS-driven push-on-completion. (6) Git push/PR endpoint tests + malformed request body tests. +19 tests → 1456 tests, 24 suites. |
| S92 | Operator P3 — multi-project dashboard, settings page, session output viewer, real-time chain progress, P4 test coverage. (1) Multi-project dashboard: nav project selector on all pages, htmx:configRequest global filter injection, cost-summary project filter. (2) Settings page: settings.mjs persistence with atomic writes + validation/clamping, GET/PUT API routes, settings.html form, applySettingsDefaults() pre-fills quick-start model. (3) Session output viewer: terminal.mjs ANSI-to-HTML converter with 16 color classes, renderTerminalViewer() replaces raw <pre> in session handoff view. (4) Real-time chain progress: WS-driven updates replace aggressive polling (5s→15-30s), chain:assumed-complete bridged, chain.html per-chain WS listener, dashboard debounced reload on chain:* events. (5) P4 test coverage: +26 tests — settings API (4), settings page (1), chain sort (2), terminal ANSI (5), terminal render (4), settings form view (1), cost-summary filter (2), chain list sort/filter (5), agent grid (2). +26 tests → 1482 tests, 24 suites. |
| S93 | Operator P5 — integration & core gaps. (1) Settings CLI integration: operator.mjs imports loadSettings(), parseArgs defaults removed so CLI flags can be distinguished from saved settings, merge priority: CLI > saved settings > hardcoded default. MODEL_MAP hoisted to module-level constant (eliminates 3 duplicates). (2) Combined mode --operator wiring: server.mjs imports runChain from operator.mjs, creates adapter wrapper bridging runChainFn(chain) → runChain(config, registry, chain). operator.mjs isMain guard prevents main() from running when imported. (3) Chain delete button: delete button (btn--delete) in chain-row.mjs for non-running chains, delete button on chain detail page, chain:deleted event emitted from DELETE handler + added to BRIDGED_EVENTS in ws.mjs. (4) Chain pagination: views.mjs chain-list accepts page/limit params, hx-swap-oob renders pagination controls outside tbody, hidden page input in #chain-filters, setPage() JS, page resets on sort/filter change, pagination CSS styles. (5) Empty state text fix: "Start one below!" → "Start one above!". +9 tests → 1491 tests, 24 suites. |
| S94 | Operator P6 — UI feature gaps. (1) Git commit UI: added commit message input + Commit button to git-status fragment when dirty (form POSTs to /api/git/commit), Push button alongside. (2) Chain text search: added ?q= query param filter in views.mjs chain-list (case-insensitive task text match), debounced search input in #chain-filters on index.html. (3) Chain detail branch display: added Branch field to chain-meta section when chain.config.branch is set. (4) Form submission loading states: CSS-based loading — .htmx-request disables submit buttons (opacity + pointer-events) and shows spinning border via ::after pseudo-element. (5) Auto-push server-side persistence: added autoPush boolean to settings.mjs DEFAULTS/loadSettings/saveSettings, git-status toggle renders checked from server, toggleAutoPush() PUTs to /api/settings instead of localStorage, WS auto-push listener fetches /api/settings, autoPush checkbox added to settings form. Tests unchanged: 1491 tests, 24 suites. |
| S95 | Operator P7 — polish & enhancements. (1) WS reconnection: created shared createWS() utility in app.js with exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s→…→30s max), refactored all 3 WS connection points (dashboard, chain detail, orchestrator log) to use it. (2) Keyboard shortcuts: N key opens/focuses new chain task input, / key focuses chain search input (both skip when inside form elements). (3) SVG favicon: two interlocking circles (chain links) in accent colors, added as data URI to all 4 HTML pages. (4) WS connection status indicator: small dot next to "Operator" brand in nav, green=connected/red=disconnected/yellow=connecting, driven by createWS trackStatus option. (5) Styled confirm dialog: HTML <dialog> element dynamically created in app.js, intercepts HTMX hx-confirm events globally via htmx:confirm listener, danger-styled buttons for delete/abort/stop actions, backdrop blur, click-outside-to-close. Tests unchanged: 1491 tests, 24 suites. |
